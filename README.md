# ConnectLifeApp
ConnectLife is an android blood donation application that makes it easier for blood doners to connect with people in need. This app aims to bridge the blood demand and supply gap in the country since donation rates within the country are still lower than 1% and at the existing level, shortage amounts to as much as 40 per cent.
Through this app I aspire to motivate more people to join the cause and actively take part in this noble trend: "Donate Blood, Share Life" 

 The app, helps consumers find potential blood doners around while any member has freewill to accept or decline the request as well. Requests can either be posted for oneselves or on behalf of someone else. In either case, user is notified instantly once their request is accepted.
